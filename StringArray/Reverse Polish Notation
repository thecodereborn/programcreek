Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation. Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression. For example:

  ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"] -> ((2 + 1) * 3) -> 9
  ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"] -> (4 + (13 / 5)) -> 6
  	
A nice property of RPN; when evaluating our expression, we donâ€™t need to consider operation precedence, or parentheses. Instead, operations are applied as they appear. This makes the process far simpler, and it can be seen that if we have a way of converting an infix input to a Reverse Polish Notation form, then our final answer can be calculated without too much trouble.

1. The solution of the above problem is >>> to Use STACK ... 
	i. push the operator in the stack till an operand appears
   ii. pop out two operator of the stack << top of stack and second top of stack  ( op1 and op2 )	
  iii. evaluate the two operator in sequence ( op2 operand op1 ) ..{ sequence is important to follow }
   iv. push the evaluated value in the stack  and continue the process till the end of operation
