 Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always separated by a single space.

For example,
Given s = "the sky is blue",
return "blue is sky the".

Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?

1. ONE OF THE way to solve this question is to put the string in array word by word and print out the array in reverse order.
    O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity 
    
2. SECOND WAY IS TO   input the string and get the length of the string and do the swapping of the words of the string using the 
   half length of string as common denominator.
