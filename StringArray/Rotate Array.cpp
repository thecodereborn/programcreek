Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]. How many different ways do you know to solve this problem?


1.  The problem can be solved by dividing array in two array .. the first array is of size n-k and the second array of the remaining size
	now merge the two array in reverse order( meaning second array + first array)
